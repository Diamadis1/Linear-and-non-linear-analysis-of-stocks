# Linear-and-non-linear-analysis-of-stocks
In this paper, five stocks mainly from the technology industry are considered for a 
linear analysis and from the perspective of complex networks.

We use various functions
to extract information from the linear analysis and the visibility graph method to construct networks. 
More specifically, ACF, PACF and CCF were used as well as granger causality tests for our linear analysis.

Recurrence plots were employed along with complex network time series analysis,

while hierarchical clustering method was finally used along with dendrograms.

The data set is considered during a possible economic recession period and the results indicated correlations and relationships to some degree between our time series,
useful information was extracted also from complex networks which helped us visualize the data set and extract information related to the topological metrics,
hierarchical cluster analysis also had a big part in our analysis in which indicated strong connections between the data set.

Knowledge of dynamic characteristics combined with all the previous information could establish strong investing strategies,
risk management strategies and could provide some insight into the stock market.
